    "There are various subtleties that we left out here, to get quickly to the equations we need in the code. First, there are some variations on the form of the pressure Poisson equation, depending on what terms involving $\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{u}$ one chooses to cancel (this has caused long arguments in the literature!). Second, we say nothing about the boundary conditions, which can cause some trouble (and more arguments!). And third, we show only the simplest iterative method for solving the Poisson equation, which also happens to be the slowest to converge. This is just meant to be a pedagogical example and discussion of these subtleties would be part of a full-fledged CFD course."
